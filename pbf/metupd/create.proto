// CreateI is the input for creating metric updates. That is persisting
// datapoints and text which belong together in order to form a metric update.
// Metrics and updates are separate resources. For lifecycle events like
// creation and deletion we want to manage a single entity. That is to reduce
// operational complexity and thus minimize failure scenarious. Otherwise
// creating metrics and updates separately would imply the technical challenge
// to reliably associate each resource with the other.
//
// A timeline can have many metric updates. A timeline thus can have many
// metrics and many updates each while any metric is only associated with a
// single update respectively. Below is an example JSON representation showing
// an emitted metric update for the dimensions x and y, where x represents a
// unix timestamp and y represents a numeric value given by the user at that
// time. Additionally the user's written update in natural language is provided.
